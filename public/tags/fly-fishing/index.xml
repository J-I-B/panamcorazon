After years on the water, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that this technique accounts for the vast majority of my trout catches, and mastering it can transform your fly fishing success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-nymph-fishing&#34;&gt;What is Nymph Fishing?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nymph fishing targets the subsurface stage of aquatic insects, which trout feed on about 90% of the time.

Tom here, and today I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my knowledge about fly fishing basics. After years of practicing this beautiful technique, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that getting started doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fly-fishing&#34;&gt;What is Fly Fishing?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional fishing where the weight of the lure pulls the line, fly fishing uses the weight of the line to cast an almost weightless &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo; that mimics insects and other fish food. It&amp;rsquo;s as much an art as it is a sport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
